# day4

**day4** is a simple, addictive iOS matching game built using UIKit with some integrated SwiftUI components. I created this app as a fun day project to refresh my knowledge in UIKit and practice working with SwiftUI inside a UIKit environment.

## Gameplay
- The game is super casual. You tap **Begin**, and you're shown a 3x4 grid of cards.
- Each card is part of a pair. You have 3 seconds to memorize the positions of the cards before they flip over.
- Your goal is to match the pairs from memory. As you progress, your **current streak score** and **high score** are displayed.
- The game continues indefinitely â€” play as long as you like!
- No data is recorded, and there are no complicated rules. It's a perfect little mini-game to pass the time.
